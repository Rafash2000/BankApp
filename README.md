The application is written in Java and provides full access for customers, employees, and 
administrators. Customers can make transfers, while employees can open and close 
customer accounts, deposit and withdraw money from customer accounts. Administrators 
are responsible for managing employees and granting permissions, and all users have the 
ability to change their account password. All user data is stored in an Oracle database, 
ensuring system security and reliability
